# Violastro Music Project Files-
Rules and Guidelines:
you may use these project files to remix and cover songs from the mod (the ones that still do exsist anyways) as long as you give credit to HuntertronGames&Music (HTG&M)

if other assets from the mod were to be used for a video upload give credit to the whole mod team (please note i have no control when it comes to assets outside music)

fan continuations for the songs that got cut or wasnt finished are allowed for my case, but
please give proper credits if you do so please

if your getting alot of errors, this is very common as i dont use any of LMMS's default stuff, most cases tho it will still load if you push through all the errors

the version of LMMS i recommend for these files is the latest nightly build located at
https://lmms.io/download
